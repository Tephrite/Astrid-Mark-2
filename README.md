Astrid is a virtual assistant based off J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron man. Jarvis takes care of everything in Tony Starks life whilst also being sentient and conversational.

Astrid is being developed using artificial intelligence and neural networks

Currently Astrid's capabilities are
- Tell the weather and temperature
- Tell the time
- Play music through Spotify
- Basic intent NLP
- Basic Entitiy recognition for geo tags
- Action recognition (eg waving)
- Object detection

Models use both Tensorflow and PyTorch in order to develop and train the neural networks
